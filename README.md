# DJANGO

Django is a web framework - a set of tools designed to help you create interactive websites. This framework is capable of responding to page requests and facilitates reading and writing in a database, managing users and other tasks.

We will create a web application called **Learning Log** that allows users to record the subjects they are interested in and create journal entries as they learn something about each subject. The Learning Log home page should describe the site and invite users to register or login. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics and add new entries, in addition to reading and editing existing entries.
